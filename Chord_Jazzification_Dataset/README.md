## Onset
The onset (measured in beats) of each chord.

## Chord Symbol
(R = root, C = Color, B = Bass)<br />
R:M, R:M6, R:Madd2, R:Madd9, R:M7, <br />
R:m, R:m6, R:madd9, R:m7, <br />
R:mM7,<br />
R:sus4,<br />
R:aug, <br />
R:dim, R:dim7,<br />
R:7, R:7sus4, R:7(+11), R:7(+5),<br />
R:m7-5,<br />
R:C(9/b9/#9/+9/-9/+11/#11), <br />
R:C/B,<br />
None<br />

## Coloring
Coloring indicates the chord degrees which appear in the voicing but are notspecified by the chord symbol, and vice versa, e.g.,(o1,9) indicates that the root is omitted and the 9th is added.<br />
<br />
Vocabulary:<br />
1: o1<br />
2: 2 (defaut = M2), #2 (for R:aug), b2<br />
3: 3 (according to triad quality), o3<br />
4: 4<br />
5: o5, #5 (= b13)<br />
6: 6 (default = M6), m6 (for R:m7-5), b6<br />
7: M7, m7, d7<br />
9: 9 (defaut = M9), #9, b9 <br />
11: 11, #11, b11<br />
13: 13 (defaut = M13), #13, b13<br />
None<br />

## Voicing
Voicing represents the configuration of eachchord with a set of scientific pitch notations, e.g., (Db2,Db3,F4,Ab4,Eb5).
<br />
Vocabulary:<br />
N = note name, R = register, accidental = {#,b,x,d} where x = double sharp, d = double flat<br />
N{#,b,x,d}R<br />
None<br />

## Tonality
R(#/b):M or R(#/b):m<br />
e.g., C:M = C major, c#:m = C# minor<br />

## Roman Numeral
Roman Numeral denotes the scale degree on which a chord is built, as well as the quality and the inversion information, e.g., V7stands for a dominant seventh chord in root position.<br />
<br />
Vocabulary:<br />
upper case Roman numeral = mojor triad<br />
lower case Roman numeral = minor triad<br />
upper case with '+' = augmented triad<br />
lower case with '-' = diminished chord<br />
upper case with '^7' = major seventh chord<br />
lower case with '7' = minor seventh chord<br />
lower case with '-7' = diminished seventh chord<br />
lower case with '=7' = half diminished chord<br />
lower case with '^7' = minor major seventh chord<br />
upper case with '+7' = augmented dominant seventh chord<br />
None<br />
<br />
6 = triad (1st inversion) <br />
64 = trid (2nd inversion)<br />
7 = 7th chord (root position)<br />
65 = 7th chord (1st inversion)<br />
43 = 7th chord (2nd inversion)<br />
42 = 7th chord (3rd inversion)<br />
N6 = Neapolitan chord<br />
It+6 = Italian sixth<br />
Fr+6 = French sixth<br />
Gr+6 = German sixth<br />
<br />
for compound chord<br />
\[ = begin<br />
\* = inside<br />
\] = end<br />

## Scale Degree
For normal chords, the 1st (primary) degree = 1; for altered chords (represented as 2nd degree/1st degree), the 1st (primary) degree != 1<br />
'#' before number = sharp<br />
'b' before number = flat<br />
None<br />

## Chord Quality
M = major<br />
m = minor<br />
M7 = major 7th<br />
m7 = minor 7th<br />
D7 = dominant 7th<br />
mM7 = minor major 7th<br />
d = diminished<br />
d7 = diminished 7th<br />
h7 = half diminished 7th<br />
aM7 = augmented major 7th<br />
aD7 = augmented dominant 7th<br />
a = agumented triad<br />
a6 = agumented 6th (+4: It+6, Fr+6, Gr+6)<br />
None<br />

## Inversion
0 = root position<br />
1 = 1st inversion<br />
2 = 2nd inversion<br />
3 = 3rd inversion (for 7th chord only)<br />
None<br />
