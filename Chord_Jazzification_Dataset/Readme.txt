=onset=
The onset(measured in beats) of each chord.

=Chord Symbol=
(R = root, C = Color, B = Bass)
R:M, R:M6, R:Madd2, R:Madd9, R:M7, 
R:m, R:m6, R:madd9, R:m7, 
R:mM7,
R:sus4,
R:aug, 
R:dim, R:dim7,
R:7, R:7sus4, R:7(+11), R:7(+5),
R:m7-5,
R:C(9/b9/#9/+9/-9/+11/#11), 
R:C/B,
None

=Coloring=
Coloring indicates the chord degrees which appear in the voicing but are notspecified by the chord symbol, and vice versa, e.g.,(o1,9) indicates that the root is omitted and the 9th is added.

Vocabulary:
1: o1
2: 2 (defaut = M2), #2 (for R:aug), b2
3: 3 (according to triad quality), o3
4: 4
5: o5, #5 (= b13)
6: 6 (default = M6), m6 (for R:m7-5), b6
7: M7, m7, d7
9: 9 (defaut = M9), #9, b9 
11: 11, #11, b11
13: 13 (defaut = M13), #13, b13
None

=Voicing=
Voicing represents the configuration of eachchord with a set of scientific pitch notations, e.g., (Db2,Db3,F4,Ab4,Eb5).

Vocabulary:
N = note name, R = register, accidental = {#,b,x,d} where x = double sharp, d = double flat
N{#,b,x,d}R
None

=Tonality=
R(#/b):M or R(#/b):m
e.g., C:M = C major, c#:m = C# minor

=Roman Numeral=
Roman Numeral denotes the scale degree on which a chord is built, as well as the quality and the inversion information, e.g., V7stands for a dominant seventh chord in root position.

Vocabulary:
upper case Roman numeral = mojor triad
lower case Roman numeral = minor triad
upper case with '+' = augmented triad
lower case with '-' = diminished chord
upper case with '^7' = major seventh chord
lower case with '7' = minor seventh chord
lower case with '-7' = diminished seventh chord
lower case with '=7' = half diminished chord
lower case with '^7' = minor major seventh chord
upper case with '+7' = augmented dominant seventh chord
None

6 = triad (1st inversion) 
64 = trid (2nd inversion)
7 = 7th chord (root position)
65 = 7th chord (1st inversion)
43 = 7th chord (2nd inversion)
42 = 7th chord (3rd inversion)

N6 = Neapolitan chord
It+6 = Italian sixth
Fr+6 = French sixth
Gr+6 = German sixth

for compound chord
[ = begin
* = inside
] = end

=Scale Degree=
For normal chords, the 1st (primary) degree = 1; for altered chords (represented as 2nd degree/1st degree), the 1st (primary) degree != 1

'#' before number = sharp
'b' before number = flat
None

=Chord Quality=
M = major
m = minor
M7 = major 7th
m7 = minor 7th
D7 = dominant 7th
mM7 = minor major 7th
d = diminished
d7 = diminished 7th
h7 = half diminished 7th
aM7 = augmented major 7th
aD7 = augmented dominant 7th
a = agumented triad
a6 = agumented 6th (+4: It+6, Fr+6, Gr+6)
None

=Inversion=
0 = original
1 = 1st
2 = 2st
3 = 3st (for 7th chord only)
None
